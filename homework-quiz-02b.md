In order to encourage engagement, the site employs a [sticker system](http://levynewsnetwork.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/2011-01-26-get-glue-sticker-collection.png). Here's [how they've described it](http://getglue.com/faq#stickers):

> As you do certain things on GetGlue you will be rewarded with a variety of stickers for your efforts or achievements. They're a cool way for you to display to other Glue-ers what kinds of entertainment you like. Some stickers are earned once and stay on your profile forever, others are earned for a specific period of time. While it is clear how you can earn some stickers, others are a bit mysterious and require you to figure out how to earn them on your own. Stickers can be earned via the website, the browser add-on, and the iPhone app.
