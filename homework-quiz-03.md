## Question 1

Which of the following is an example of an insight from behavioral economics: (Check all that apply)

* [x] A person is less likely to opt-in to donate organs than to opt-out.(As discussed in lecture 6.2, behavioral economists point out the “Default Rule” or the tendency for people to stick with the default option that they perceive to be chosen by everyone else)
* [x] When writing a research paper, a person is likely to choose sources that support his or her opinion.(As discussed in lecture 6.2, behavioral economists study “Confirmation Bias” or the tendency for people to choose and believe pieces of reasoning that confirm their prior beliefs)
* [x] The fear of losing 5 dollars is stronger than the positive feeling of gaining 5 dollars.(As discussed in lecture 6.2, behavorial economists also focus on the idea of “Loss Aversion”, which refers to people’s general tendency to experience greater fear of losing something than the joy of gaining the same amount)
* [ ] Certain people are genetically predisposed to be risk-takers, and they tend to be taller than average.
* [ ] A banker will tend to structure a deal based on rational choices for wealth maximization, rather than a desire to help others.(As discussed in lecture 6.2, this statement describes the traditional economics assumption that humans are rational actors whose behavior can be described by models focusing on incentives and maximization of utility or self-interest. Behavioral economics on the other hand looks at actual behavior and accounts for various irrational biases that influence decision-making.)


## Question 2

According to self-determination theory, a proposal to pay students US $10 for every course in which they receive an “A” (the best possible grade) would be:

* ( ) a good idea because competition for rewards is the primary thing that motivates humans.
* ( ) a bad idea because only large cash rewards have been found to motivate people.
* ( ) a good idea because the best students deserve to be rewarded.
* (x) a bad idea because it could crowd out intrinsic motivation to learn.


## Question 3
According to self-determination theory, if a parent tells his/her child to read the newspaper every day, which of the following is most likely to be the case?

* (x) If the parent uses the promise of a daily $1 cash reward as motivation, the child may not develop a regular habit of reading the newspaper as an adult.(Self-determination theory shows that extrinsic rewards can actually be de-motivating if they crowd out intrinsic motivation. Here, once the child is an adult, they will no longer have the parents' promised reward to motivate them to read the paper.)
* ( ) The child is only likely to develop a regular habit of reading the newspaper as an adult if the parent uses tangible rewards, as opposed to punishment, as a form of motivation.(Self-determination theory, like behaviorism, makes no sharp distinction between rewards and punishment. It focuses on the way that extrinsic rewards can be demotivating. The promise of a tangible reward, as specified in this answer, is not likely to lead to a regular habit of reading, according to self-determination theory.)
* ( ) The child will never develop a regular habit of reading the newspaper as an adult, because the parent told him/her to start reading.
* ( ) The child is more likely to develop a regular habit of reading the newspaper as an adult if the parent punishes him/her every time he/she does not read.


## Question 4

Jack and Jill, two friends who want to improve their fitness, agree to exercise together at 6 am every day. After two weeks they both become frustrated about how many sessions the other is missing. To encourage reliable participation, they agree that any time one of them misses a day, they must pay a $5 penalty to the other. However, after a few more weeks, attendance worsens further. Which of the following could best explain this?

* (x) Over-justification effect
* ( ) Classical conditioning
* ( ) Loss aversion
* ( ) Task non-contingent rewards


## Question 5

Gamification builds on several contemporary business practices outside the games industry. Identify some of those practices from the list below: (Check all that apply)

* [x] Frequent-flyer programs
* [ ] Cloud computing
* [x] Social networks and social media
* [ ] Zones of proximal development
* [ ] Constitutive rules
* [x] Management research related to workplace performance


## Question 6

Identify which of the following statements involves intrinsic motivation according to self-determination theory: (Check all that apply)

* [ ] I play World of Warcraft because all the cool kids in my school do.
* [x] I play World of Warcraft because I can choose what I do within the game. (This statement reflects the player's autonomy, which is one of the three intrinsic motivators according to self-determination theory.)
* [x] I play World of Warcraft because I find it continually challenging to be an effective raid healer as my guild progresses through more difficult encounters.
* [ ] I play World of Warcraft because I want to spend time with my boyfriend, and that's all he does all weekend.
* [x] I play World of Warcraft because playing with my friends makes me feel like I'm part of a larger community.(This statement reflects the player's sense of relatedness, which is one of the three intrinsic motivators according to self-determination theory.)


## Question 7

Research suggests that leaderboards can make people less engaged in a task. Which of the following explanations is consistent with the psychological theories described in the lectures?

* ( ) Leaderboards are inherently imprecise because they emphasize relative, rather than absolute, performance.
* ( ) Leaderboards are not game elements.
* ( ) Leaderboards weed out those who never cared that much anyway.
* (x) Leaderboards can substitute a focus on competition and extrinsic rewards for intrinsic enjoyment of a task.


## Question 8

Which of the following is a concern regarding the use of behaviorism in gamification? (Check all that apply)

* [ ] Using a schedule for rewards inevitably limits their motivational effects.
* [x] It works primarily by maintaining an expectation for rewards, whose effectiveness as motivators can decay over time.
* [x] It doesn't directly promote intrinsic motivation, and extrinsic motivation has significant limitations.
* [ ] Behaviorism emphasizes punishments before rewards.
* [ ] Intangible rewards are always less effective than tangible ones.(There is no such finding. Both tangible and intangible rewards can have the same effects. Moreover, the distinction between tangible and intangible rewards does not address the effectiveness of behaviorism.)

## Question 9

Which of the following is a unique element that video games can offer but other kinds of games typically do not?

* ( ) Contrived contingencies in which limited freedom is exercised.
* ( ) A series of meaningful choices.
* (x) Immersion in an interactive, virtual environment.
* ( ) Closed, formal systems.
* ( ) Structured conflict that often results in unequal outcomes.

## Question 10

According to self-determination theory, which of the following is the closest to intrinsic motivation?

* (x) Integration(As described in lecture 6.5, integration is a complete alignment between personal goals and the externally-imposed objective. However, the person still feels that the motivation comes from outside.)
* ( ) External regulation
* ( ) Intentionality
* ( ) Amotivation


## Question 11

TripAdvisor, a travel information website, announces to its members that any registered member who submits more than 50 reviews will receive a “Star Contributor” digital badge on their website profile. Under Cognitive Evaluation Theory, how would such a reward be described? (Check all that apply)

* [ ] Performance contingent
* [ ] Engagement contingent
* [ ] Task non-contingent
* [ ] Engagement contingent
* [ ] Tangible
* [x] Expected(As discussed in lecture 5.4. Since TripAdvisor has shared with the audience the exact criteria for how to earn this reward, the reward is not a surprise.)


## Question 12

[The Free Rice game](http://freerice.com/#/english-vocabulary/1528) has players participate in a vocabulary game. For every correct answer a player gets, ten grains of rice are donated through the World Food Programme. It also offers visitors to the site the opportunity to build their knowledge of English vocabulary. In what way does this site appeal to intrinsic motivation?

* (x) It offers the player the chance to develop competency in vocabulary
* ( ) Everyone considers learning vocabulary to be fun. (While some people may feel this way, others find learning vocabulary to be a chore. If everyone found it fun, there would be no need to motivate students to learn vocabulary in school.)
* ( ) It incorporates every player into a social network of other players.
* ( ) It offers players a choice of tasks and characters.
* ( ) It offers players a choice of prizes.
* (x) It relates the player to a global cause.(By connecting the outcome of the player's performance with the donation of rice to hungry children in the world, this game creates a situation in which the player's actions tap into a feeling of relatedness as defined in self-determination theory in lecture 6.5.)


## Question 13
John designs a gamified process to increase audience engagement for a movie reviews website. For every three reviews that a user clicks on to read, he/she is awarded 10 points. What kind of a reward schedule is John implementing?

* ( ) Continuous
* ( ) Intrinsic
* (x) Fixed ratio(As discussed in 5.5. The player gets a reward after every 3 actions of a certain type, irrespective of time interval between.)
* ( ) Triennial


## Question 14
Whether directed towards external customer engagement, internal employee performance enhancement, or behavioral change, all three forms of gamification work towards a common ambition. How could this ambition be described?

* ( ) Motivating participants toward achieving defined goals.
* ( ) Identifying the most talented players.
* ( ) Dividing large problems into small ones that can be handled by a large number of inexpensive computers.(While crowdsourcing (dividing up problems among a large population) is one application of gamification, it is not applicable across all three categories. Moreover, gamification involves people, not computers, as the actors.)
* ( ) Changing the environment so that the players are financially better off.


## Question 15
Which of the following are findings of behaviorism which can potentially be used by gamification: (Check all that apply)
* [ ] Interpretation of dreams can be a productive way to understand human motivation.
* [x] Designers can learn through observation of players' responses to stimuli.
* [ ] By questioning people about their feelings, we can understand what game elements are likely to motivate them. (Although a potentially valuable area of research, an individual's expression of their feelings represent an internal and unquantifiable state, excluding it from the field of behaviorism.)
* [x] A feedback loop's circular process of stimulus, response, and feedback can result in learning.
