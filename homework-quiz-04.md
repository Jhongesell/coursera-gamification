* ( ) Progression loops are just another name for points, badges and leaderboards (PBLs).

## Question 10

In 2010, the site DevHub attempted to gamify site development through its system. When some of its users questioned this decision, the developers posted a response. Read the following excerpt from their response:

> While there were definitely some standout users who knew how to build great sites on this old system, a majority of our users were usually stuck very early on -- they'd send us messages like "What do I do next?" or "How can I do more?".  What resulted was a few great sites and a lot of other sites being created with very minimal content, lots of ads, and no real value provided to a visitor.”

While the article in its entirety addresses several concerns, this excerpt indicates specific considerations the developers made when they chose to gamify the site. Which of the following best describes these considerations?

* (x) Broadening sustained engagement to a larger percentage of users.
* ( ) Satisfying users' desire for status by giving them access to exclusive content.
* ( ) Making employees more productive.
* ( ) Playing a game will distract users from the fact that designing websites is inherently boring.
