# Lecture notes 7 - Motivation & psychology - Part 1

## Motivational design

### MLB

MLB.com launched a badge system that rewarded watching games on their live stream.

> I was _obsessed_ with MLB.com's 'badges', this curious sidebar diversionâ€¦

The service was not renewed for 2012. but it nevertheless had a positive effect on, with users saying:

> I felt like a moth to a flame.


### Apple

Apple launched the apple store with the idea that people would come in and hang around to make a lifestyle-oriented service.


## Behaviorism


### The behaviorist program

Internal cognitive states are not scientifically testable. It restricts investigation to what goes in and what comes out of a person.

* Stimulus
* Behavior
* Consequences

The process of learning involves the modification of behavior over time as a result of experiencing consequences.


### Behavioral economics

* People make mistakes consistently
	* Loss aversion
	* Power of defaults
	* Confirmation bias


### Learnings from behaviorism

* Observation
* Feedback loops
* Reinforcement


## Behaviorism in gamification

* Watch what people do
* Importance of feedback
* Conditioning through consequences
* Reinforcement through reward


### The dopamine system

Brain chemistry linked to both pleasure and learning.

Behavioral gamification tends toward creating rewards that maximize the engagement based on dopamine release and it's addictive quality.


## Reward structures

### Cognitive evaluation theory

* Tangible/intangible
* Expected/unexpected
* Contingency
	* Task non-contingent
	* Engagement-contingent
	* Completion-contingent
	* Performance-contingent


## Reward schedules

* Continuous
* Fixed ratio
* Fixed interval
* Variable

Continuous schedules are automatic and not very engaging.

Fixed ratios and intervals have some value but the brain tends to pick up on the pattern.

Variable schedule are the most interesting because our brains love surprises--things that are different or out of place with the terrain.

### Variability

* Competitive/non-competitive
* Certain/uncertain

The most powerful example of a variable schedule reward machine is a slot machine. The reward comes just enough that you don't give up. This can be dangerous because people can stop knowing what they are doing and make poor choices.
