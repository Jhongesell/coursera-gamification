# Lecture notes 7 - Motivation & psychology - Part 2

## Limitations of behaviorism

* Leaves out a lot
* Treats person as a black box and ignores the fact that they should be the center of the experience


## Dangers of behaviorism

### Potential for abuse/manipulation

#### Potential for manipulation
Business owners can start thinking like casino operators.

#### Hedonic treadmill
Once people learn to respond to the reward, you cannot stop or the people cease the behavior. This is especially true once the brain figures out the pattern.

#### Overemphasis on status
People do things for lots of other reasons:

* Tangible
* Altruistic
* Social


## Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation

The cognitive model focuses on opening the black box in behaviorism and understanding what's going on.

Intrinsic means you do something for it's own sake.

> I love my job so much I'd do it for free.

Extrinsic means you do something for some reason other than the thing itself

* Money
* Fame & fortune
* Someone you value asked you to do it


### SAPS (Zichermann)

* Status
* Access
* Power
* Stuff

Zichermann makes two assertions:

1. Hierarchy (top to bottom) and companies should implement them in order of value
2. These are also rank ordered in terms of potency

There is a danger in assuming that status is the most powerful gamification concept. Status grubbers might not be your best customers.


## How rewards can demotivate

Rewards acting as extrinsic motivators can crowd out in the intrinsic motivators that are there. This is called the over-justification effect.

* The reward substitutes for the intrinsic motivation
* Studies confirm
	* Drawing
	* Day care pickup
	* Blood donation
	* Teacher salaries

Meta-analysis of these studies show they do have limitations:

* Generally focuses on "interesting" tasks
* Reward types do matter
	* Tangible
	* Unexpected
	* Performance-contingent 


## Self determination theory

Intrinsic motivation is a more powerful way to get people to act in certain ways than extrinsic motivation.


### The motivational spectrum

* Amotivation
* Extrinsic
	* External motivation (someone tells you to do something)
	* Introjection (making external motivators your own)
	* Identification (making motivator our own)
	* Integration (complete alignment between goals and the thing)
* Intrinsic
	* Worthwhile and motivating in and of itself

### What does it take to make something intrinsically motivating?

__Competence:__ Ability, solving problems, achieving something within the activity.

__Autonomy:__ In control, I am the one making the choices, meaningful choices.

__Relatedness:__ Your activity is connected to something beyond yourself. Being a team player, being social, doing good for the environment.
