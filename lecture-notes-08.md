# Lecture notes 8 - Design Choices

## Taking stock

Is a slot machine a game?

* No
	* No meaningful choices
	* Not based on skill
	* Random determination
* Yes
	* Engagement loops
	* Involve surprise
	* Pattern searching

There is something game-like about a slot machine.

Two main approaches to gamification:


### Doing

* Marketing & economics
* Incentives
* Satisfying needs
* Game elements
	* Inductive
	* Building up from the bottom
* Status
* PBLs
* Rewards
* Making users do things


### Feeling

* Game design and cognitive psychology
* Experiences
* Fun
* Game thinking
	* Deductive
	* Top down from principles
* Meaning
* Puzzles
* Progression
* Making players awesome


## Is gamification right for me

Four questions:

1. Motivation
	* Where would you derive value from encouraging behavior?
2. Meaningful choices
	* Are your target activities sufficiently interesting?
3. Structure
	* Can the desired behaviors be modeled through algorithms?
4. Potential conflicts
	* Can the game avoid tension with other motivational structures


### Motivation

* Emotional connections, unique skills, creativity, or teamwork
* Or, to make boring tasks interesting


### Meaningful choices

In the Google News badge example, the gamification elements fail to provide a connection for the user to the outside world.


### Structure

* Must be able to encode in rules/algorithms
* _E.g._ points for Twitter sharing vs. product registration


### Conflicts

Lee Sheldon (professor at Rensselaer) gamified his courses so students built up points rather than subtracted their grade from an A.

When these systems were put into parallel use they came into conflict.


## Design for collective good

All quotes from [Jeff Atwood, Stack Overflow](http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-gamification/)

Fun...

> The field of programming is almost by definition one of constant learning.
> Programming is supposed to fun...

Notion of working together as a team...

> Stack Overflow is in many ways my personal Counter-Strike… The design of Stack Overflow makes helping your fellow programmers the most effective way to 'win'…

Pro-social goals...

> So then the problem becomes how do you encourage groups to do what's best for the world rather than their own specific, selfish needs?


> [A]ll the gaming elements are there in service of a higher purpose… I believe it ultimately helps me become more knowledgable and a better communicator while also improving the very fabric of the web for everyone.


## Designing for happiness

### Positive psychology

* Martin Seligman
* Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi

Psychology is based on pathology, or what can go wrong. Positive psychology looks at what it takes to make people happy and high-functioning.

* Positive emotions
* Engagement
* Relationships
* Meaning
* Achievement

### Flow

There is a state that we sometimes get into that we are so engaged in what we are doing that we lose sense of time and are fully and completely engaged. Occurs at least as often in work activities as in entertainment activities.

If the difficulty channel over time stays between anxiety and boredom, it is said to flow.

#### Conditions

* Clear goals
* Balance between perceived challenges and perceived skills
* Clear and immediate feedback


## Amy Jo Kim interview

Expert in the development of social architectures. Teaches workshops on game design and gamification.

The word 'gamification' will go away but the techniques and toolsets will become integral to all design processes.

### Kim's social engagement verbs

2-axis:

* Acting/Interacting
* Content/Players

4 groups (verb based):

* Expressing: Acting/Content
* Exploring: Interacting/Content
* Competing: Acting/Players
* Collaborating: Interacting/Players

Social engagement verbs & actions

|Express|Explore|Compete|Collaborate|
|----------------------|
|build, create, design, purchase, decorate, customize, choose|view, collect, rate, vote, review, curate|win, challenge, showoff, compare, taunt|comment, like, greet, help, share, give|

> Game: A system in which players engage in an artificial conflict, defined by rules, that results in a quantifiable outcome
> 
> --Rules of Play

Amy Jo defines games as:

> GAME: A structured experience with rules and goal's that's fun to play
>
> -- Engagement design

…which applies especially to non-zero sum games.

People from the web are used to funnels and habit loops. What they are not used to is the idea that the player's role changes over time. This is referred to as the "player's journey".

Think about your engagement loops at each stage of the lifecycle.
