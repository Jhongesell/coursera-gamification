# Lecture notes 9 - Enterprise gamification


## Enterprise applications

* Intranet engagement
	* Encourage people to contribute
	* Leaderboards identify people with expertise
* Productivity enhancement
	* Increase motivation
	* Provide feedback
* Efficiency enhancement
	* _e.g._ the email game
* Knowledge management
* Human resources
	* Hiring
	* Onboarding
	* Acculturation
	* Corporate training
	* Performance review
	* Employee recognition
	* Travel & Entertainment
* Innovation
* Serious games


## Workplace motivation

### Extrinsic rewards

* Play
* Bonuses
* Stock options
* Praise
* Promotions
* Responsibility

These are all extrinsic motivators. These are all things you receive as compensation for doing something that you don't really want to do. These are not the whole story.


### Intrinsic rewards

* Skill development
	* People working from home a couple hours a day/week
* Information
	* Muse providing feedback to waiters and restaurants
* Corporate citizenship
	* Microsoft employees improvement localized versions of windows because it improves the product
* Fun
	* Employee facebook's quizzing people on their co-workers


## The game vs. the job

Employees have a strong drive to go in the direction the game is pushing them. The goals of the game should line up with the job requirements and company goals.


### Citizenship behaviors

* Altruism
* Conscientiousness
* Civic virtue
* Courtesy
* Sportsmanship


### Matrix

Gamification works well in the following scenarios:

||core|unique|future|
|-------------------|
|In-role|||X|
|Citizenship|X|||


## Playbor

Play + Labor

Disneyland employees refer to monitoring system as 'electronic whip'.

> I was nervous… and felt that I was being controlled even more.

This does not provide intrinsic motivation and can demotivate.

> The whip has led to a sort of competition among workers some of whom have tried to race to the head of the pack. But that has led to dissension and made other employees worry that a reasonable pace won't be enough to keep the boss happy.

Similarly…

> Employees have been known to skip bathroom breaks out of fear that their production will fall and managers will demand an explanation.

It's important to think about systems can be designed to promote the beneficial aspects of gamification. And also avoid dissent and decreased performance.

Two keys are that the system is:

* Voluntary
* Transparent


## Daniel Debow interview - CEO of Rypple

Rypple amplifies behaviors.

Hired game designers but never used the word gamification or tried to make a game. Most games fail because the underlying thing you are measuring is not intrinsically rewarding.

Finding intrinsically rewarding things requires looking at the data and behaviors.

Double incentive: refer your friend and we'll reward you both. Counterintuitively, this lowered referrals for Rypple because the reward poisoned the activity.

Be empirical.


## Ethan Mollick on games at work

Graffiti in the pyramids indicates that workers were organized in teams that competed to build faster.

Consent is an important concept in gamification highlighted by researcher Michael Burawoy:

* Voluntary gamification avoid this problem
* "Mandatory Fun" requires consent
	* Understand the rules
	* Think the game is fair
	* Pay attention to the game
