# Unit 10 lecture notes - Social impact & behavior change

## Gamification for good

One preliminary issue is that there is a lot of motivation and good that comes out of games and game-like activities. But there are differences about gamification when the context is personal or social impact:

* Inherent relatedness
* Rewards for doing good?
* Behavior change


## Social good applications

### Health and wellness

Zamzee uses serious games for cancer patient recovery. The zamzee is a device that tracks physical activity and is targeted at low income teenagers in the US. A randomized study saw a 30% increase in activity levels from the zamzee.

SuperBetter is a gamification framework for improving one's quality of life and health after a traumatic injury:

* Quests
* Power-ups
* Allies (friends)
* Bad guys (undesirable activities)

### Energy and environment

Opower provides reports and feedback data on energy usage. It compares you to friends and neighbors. 2-4% improvement in energy usage in neighborhoods where Opower is implemented.

* Goals
* Leaderboard
* Friends

RecycleBank gives users points for recycling that they can spend with retail partners.

### Education

Education already has a system of feedback and rewards. The challenge in education is to make the system better and not worse.

EDucation also has a credentialing function. Traditionally this is done with diploma. This can be supplemented with the open badge framework.

### Government

Governments can act like large enterprises and implement internal gamification systems. They also interact with constituents as consumers. Thirdly they work to improve the lives of their citizens. Gamifications can be used to help a government meet it's policy goals.


## Social impact techniques

The CAPRI (__C__ongestion __A__nd __P__arking __R__elief __I__ncentives) project at Stanford seeks to resolve parking issues on campus.

* Feedback
* Monitoring
* Communal pressure

This program is unique in that data is collected automatically. Also it makes use of social norms to drive behavior.

### Competition

The __Kukui Cup__ is a competition at University of Hawaii that pits dorms against one another to lower their energy usage.


### Impact

[Practically Green](http://practicallygreen.com/) measures the amount of social good being done.


### Chance

In the CAPRI program you can use earned points to play a game of chance (chutes and ladders) with larger rewards. People like getting the chance to get a much larger reward, without it being guaranteed.


## Behavior change

### Habit formation

Habits are things you do without necessarily having to think about them.


### Fogg behavior model

B = mat (motivation, ability, trigger)

* The more motivated you are the more likely you are to do something
* The higher your ability is the easier something is, so you are more likely to do it.
* The trigger gets associated with the activity

There are several things to consider when measuring a gamification system with this framework:

* Motivation and ability trade off
* Trigger timing
* Trigger types
	* Spark - Triggers that increase motivation
	* Facilitator - Things that make a task seem easier
	* Signal - If you motivation and ability are sufficiently high you just need a reminder

In the D6 gamification framework there are two loops:

* __Engagement loop:__ Motivation, action, feedback (like addiction)
* __Progression loop:__ Perceived ability (stairs, boss fights)
* Good games trigger effectively - Provides guidance to participate more


## Susan Hunt Stevens interview

* Points
