# Unit 10 lecture notes - Criticisms & risks

## Pointsification

> What we're currently terming gamification is in fact the process of __taking the thing that is least essential to games and representing it as the core of the experience.__ Points and badges have no closer a relationship to games than they do to websites and fitness app and loyalty cards.
> --Margaret Robinson, [Hide & Seek](

Furtherâ€¦

> Gamification is an inadvertent con. It tricks people into believing that there's a simple way to imbue their thing (bank, gym, job, government, genital health outreach program, etc.) with the psychological, emotional and social power of a great game.

### Does it actually work?

* Real research on effectiveness is limited
* Potential for engagement decay
* Crowding out

> Gamification is the high fructose corn syrup of engagement.
> --Kathy Sierra


### Implications

* Names are powerful
* Bad gamification is bad
	* Behaviorist gamification is subject to the limits/dangers of rewards
* There is more to games than gamification, and vice versa
* Caveat Ludor: _Let the gamifier beware_


## Exploitationware

Gamification is potentially too effective. The idea is that gamification techniques could be used to get people to do things that are not in their best interest.

According to Ian Bogost, gamification fundamentally undermines the nature of economic and social exchange between workers and employers.

> In particular, gamification proposes to replace real incentives with fictional ones. Real incentives come at a cost but provide value for both parties based on  a relationship of trust. By contrast, pretend incentives reduce or eliminate costs, but in so doing they strip away both value and trust.
> --[Ian Bogost](http://www.bogost.com/writing/exploitationware.shtml)


## Gaming the game

Pricing on the Bay Bridge in San Francisco is congestion based. The toll is $6 before 7pm and $4 after 7pm. People will pull over to get the lower rate, potentially endangering themselves and others.


### Cheating

Cheating is a pitfall of gamification. Social games tend to see this last because the community pressures individuals to behave.


### Beneficial cheating?

In financial markets insider trading is bad because it undermines trust in markets. In social games it can contribute to goals by increasing cohesion and momentum around winning ideas.


## Legal issues

### Privacy

You get tremendous amounts of personal and behavioral information from and about players in a gamification system.


### Employment/Labor law

* Disney's Electronic whip
* PLAYBOR concept


### Other concerns

* Deceptive marketing
* Intellectual property
	* Virtual property rights?
		* Emerging area of law: Ownership vs. license
		* CARD act (U.S.): Regulates gift cards, _e.g._ what happens after expiration?


## Regulatory issues

### Paid endorsements

Some gamification mechanics can be triggered by social endorsement and could be interpreted as a paid endorsement which are regulated like advertisements and blog articles.


### Banking regulation

* Record keeping
* Reserve requirements
* Currency manipulation
* Anti-fraud
* Money laundering
* Consumer protection
* Taxation and accounting


### Sweepstakes & gambling

* State regulation of sweepstakes (U.S.)
* National regulation of gambling
	* Games of skill vs. chance
