# Unit 12 lecture notes - Beyond the basics

## Beyond the Basics

### Learning goals

1. What is gamification?
2. Why might it be valuable
3. How to do it effectively
4. Specific applications 


### Beyond the basics

* Inducement prizes (Competitive)
* Collection action (collaborative)
* Virtual economies
* The future


## Inducement Prizes

* A contest to motivate a result
* Alternative to direct funding
	* Internal R&D
	* Outsourcing

Charles Lindbergh was competing to win the $25,000 Orteig prize. It's estimate that Lindbergh and all the others spent a total of $400,000 to win. He incentivized this spending.

Inducement prizes can also encourage creativity and flexibility. People will come up with solutions that haven't been tried before.


### Prizes and gamification

* A contest to motivate a result
* Fun? Extrinsic rewards?
* Remember the Self-determination (SDT) factors
	* Competence
	* Autonomy
	* Relatedness

### Inducement prize initiatives

* Private
	* X Prize Foundation
	* Innocentive
	* Kaggle
	* TopCoder 
* Government (U.S.)
	* DARPA Grand Challenges
	* America Competes Act
	* OSTP Initiative

### Attributes

* Multiple individuals/teams capable of competing
* Costs sufficiently small
* Balance scale vs. incentives (Karim Lakhani)
* Opportunities to leverage results


## Virtual Economies

Persistent virtual rewards… Virtual goods
Trade-able/redeemable points… Virtual currency
In-game transactions/markets… Virtual economy

* Worldwide virtual asset market
	* $7 billion in 2010
	* Nearly $13 billion by 2016
* Loyalty programs as virtual currencies


### Balance

* Economic dynamics driven by _scarcity_, not money
* Faucets & Drains
	* Remember "passing Go" in Monopoly


### Danger!

* Real money costs real money
* Remember the hedonic treadmill and crowding-out effects
* Intrinsic value from rarity and surprise


## Collective Action

* Competitive/top-down: Grants
* Competitive/bottom-up: Inducement prizes
* Collaborative/top-down: Employees
* Collaborative/bottom-up: Crowdsourcing/microwork

Microwork exchanges: Amazon Mechanical Turk

* Nature of the task
	* Can it be split up easily?
	* Are humans better than computers?
* How to motivate?
	* For money, love, fun…. or all three?


## The Future of Gamification - Part 1

* No ones knows the future
* What if gamification really becomes pervasive?


### Sight

* 8-minute film by Eran May-raz and Daniel Lazo
	* Graduation project from Bezaleal Academy of Arts
* Watch closely! Think about what we've discussed
* Will be on the final
