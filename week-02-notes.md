## What is a game?

Ludwig Wittgenstein believed you cannot bound the concept of a game.

Bernard Suits believed we can define every possible game based on three precepts:

	* Pre-lusory goal
	* Constitutive rules
	* Lusory attitude

Johan Huizinga, in Homo Ludens, said games are essential to humans

The "magic circle" sets boundaries between the game and real life

In summary...

> In a game we voluntarily overcome unnecessary obstacles
	
Roger Caillois distinguished Paidia (Greek for child) or play from Ludus (Latin for games).

Play is done spontaneously for its own sake.

> A game is a series of meaningful choices
> - Sid Meier
