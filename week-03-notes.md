# Week 3 notes


## Why gamify?

Dodgeball was a very successful location based service. But they had a chicken-and-egg problem in that the incentive came from participating in your already large dodgeball network. New users had no network and so lacked the incentive to get started.

Dodgeball founder Dennis Crowley's next company was foursquare. Foursquare employed gamification to…

* Engagement gap
* Choices
* Progression
* Social
* Habit

Foursquare's gamification took the form of…

* Mayorships
* Badges
* Tips
* Points


## Thinking like a game designer

1. "I am a game designer"
2. Different that _being_ a game designer
3. Different than thinking like a _gamer_

Think of your participants as players:

* Players are at the center of a game
* PLayers feel a sense of autonomy/control
* Players <u>play</u>

Reminder: Play is a sense of exuberant activity within a set of rules

The game designers challenge is to:

* Get you players into the game
* Keep them playing


## Design rules

__Balance__

Monopoly uses the "Go" option to keep balance by injecting money into the game economy.

Games should be not too hard and not too easy. They shouldn't systematically favor one side over another.
