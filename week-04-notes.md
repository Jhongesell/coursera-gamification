# Week 4 notes - Breaking games down


## Element of Tic Tac Toe

* The board
* Tokens (X and O)
* Two players
* Competitive
* Turns
* Win and draw states
* No progression or scoring

Tic Tac Toe is an overly simplistic game that can't hold the attention of any adult for long. But it's composed of exeriences and elements that can be put into non-game contexts.


## The pyramid of elements

1. Dynamics
2. Mechanics
3. Components

The experience of the game is the summation of these 3 layers.


### Dynamics

Big-picture aspects; "grammar"

1. Constraints
2. Emotions
3. Narrative
4. Progression
5. Relationships


### Mechanics

Processes that drive action forward; "verbs"

1. Challenges
2. Chance
3. Competition
4. Cooperation
5. Fedback
6. Resource acquisition
7. Rewards
8. Transactions
9. Turns
10. Win states


### Components

Specific instantiations of mechanics and dynamics; "nouns"

1. Acheivements
2. Avatars
3. Badges
4. Boss fights
5. Collections
6. Combat
7. Content unlocking
8. Gifting
9. Leaderboards
10. Levels
11. Points
12. Quests
13. Social graph
14. Teams
15. Virtual goods

### Lessons from the pyramid

* A variety of options
* Lower levels tend to implement one or more higher-level concepts


## The PBL triad

* Points
* Badges
* Leaderboards


### Points

* Keep score
* Determin win states
* Connect to rewards
* Provide feedback
* Display of progress
* Data for the game designer
* Fungible


### Badges

* Representations of acheivement
* Flexible
* Style
* Signaling of importance
* Credentials
* Collections
* Social display (status symbols)

### Leaderboards

__Ranking__
Feedback on competition

__Personalized leaderboard__
Friend-relative variant

	DANGER: Leaderboards have been shown in research to de-motivate.


## Limitations of elements

* The elements are not the game
* Not all rewards are fun; not all fun is rewarding
* Cookie cutter


### What about?

* Meaningful choices?
* Puzzles?
* Mastery?
* Community?
* Different kinds of users?


## Interview with Bing Gordon

### Importance

> All CEO's should get familiar with gamification because it's the new normal for people born after 1971.


### Instant feeback

> Instant feedback is standard in games and can be important in life.


### Two common mistakes

1. Winning (collaboration trumps competition)
2. High score ranking (leaderboards demotivate)
