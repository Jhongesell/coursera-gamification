# Written assignment 1

## Definition

You are an employee of Cereals Incorporated, a large manufacturer of breakfast food products.  Your supervisor, Madison County, approaches you because she knows you recently took a course on gamification, which she has heard will revolutionize marketing. 

She tells you that Cereals Inc. is about to release a new line of ready-to-eat breakfast pastries, and she wants to know whether to use gamification as part of the marketing strategy.  The breakfast pastries will be aimed at the 18-35 age bracket. Surveys show members of this demographic often skip breakfast because they donâ€™t want to eat the typical cereals of their youth, and they are too active to cook their own breakfasts.  Market research indicates that the pastries are likely to appeal more to women than men by a 65%-35% ratio. Cereals Inc. has a 35% share of the overall breakfast food market, but only a 10% share of the fragmented ready-to-eat segment.  

__Provide as many reasons as you can why gamification could be a useful technique to apply to the situation your manager has presented to you.  Explain why these reasons address the specific scenario provided. __ At this stage, focus on the problem rather than the solution.  In other words, describe the goals of the project, not the particular game elements or other techniques you plan to use.  We strongly encourage you to watch this week's lecture segments before attempting this assignment.


## Format

Maximum of 300 words. A normal answer will be 1-2 paragraphs of text, and/or a set of bullet points.  Your submission should be self-contained (not requiring the grader to view any outside materials) and should provide sufficient details for the grader to understand the basis for your statements.


## Answer

Cereals Inc. has a great opportunity to increase its share of the the fragmented ready-to-eat market segment from 10% to 35% (its share of the overall breakfast food market) or higher. Gamification can compliment normal marketing activities and is very effective at speaking to the 18-35 age bracket identified as the target market for these breakfast pastries.

Gamification can increase engagement with Cereal Inc products by encouraging consumers to not skip breakfast. Various game mechanics could provide and incentive to eat breakfast every day. This habit formation will lead to additional purchase of our products.

Gamification can make breakfast more fun by providing new and more choices. Sales will increase if we convince consumers to purchase Cereal Inc products instead of our competitors by creating a positive experience associated with our brand.

Encouraging users to interact socially about our products will multiply our marketing efforts. There are several gamification elements that encourage consumers to share their experiences both online and in person with their peers.

Lastly, there is a chance that Gamification elements involving competition may increase the appeal of the pastries amongst the male demographic, which according to research will purchase infrequently based on the product alone. Closing the male engagement gap could bring our segment market share above the normative 35% for the entire category.
