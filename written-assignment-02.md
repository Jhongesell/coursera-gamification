# Written assignment 2 

## Definition

You are approached by Ryan Morrison, the mayor of a medium-sized city in the Midwest of the United States.  He has heard that you know a lot about gamification and believes that gamification techniques can transform city government.  

He would like to start with the health of city employees.  The city has 50,000 employees and they happen to have exactly the same rates of obesity as the U.S. average: 34.4% overweight (but not obese) and 33.9% of them are obese.  53.1% of the city’s employees do not meet the U.S. Physical Activity Guidelines for aerobic physical activity and 76% of them fail to meet the Guidelines for muscle-strengthening activity.  The city pays for health benefits for its employees and this cost is a huge part of the city budget.  Economists in Mayor Morrison’s office have estimated that a 3% improvement in the average physical fitness of city employees would amount to a US$94 million reduction in annual city health costs; a 5% improvement would save US$188 million.  

__Describe in general terms a gamified system that could effectively motivate behavior change to address the challenge presented above. Specifically, explain how the system would effectively incorporate intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, or both.__ Your answer should address the fact that this is an internal gamification project, targeted at the institutional goals of the city government.  The system can use any technology (or no technology!), so long as the resources required seem justified by the scope of the opportunity.

## Answer

Mayor Ryan Morrison would like to improve the health of his 50,000 city employees. Currently 34.4% are overweight, 33.9% are obese, 53.1% do not meet federal guidelines for aerobic fitness, and 76% fall short of muscle-strengthening activity guidelines. In doing so, economists say the city could save between US$94-188 million dollars in the budget.

An internal gamification project targeted at the institutional goals of the city government should be able to improve the health of city employees anywhere from 3-5%. A city employee olympics could provide fun, structure and goals to help guide the 50,000 employees on a path to better health. The olympics could consists of a series of events, regular activities, awards, and ceremonies. The key will be to effectively motivate behavior change. A cognitivist view of this program would focus on two main types of rewards: extrinsic and intrinsic.

Extrinsic motivators are things you do for some reason other than themselves. A leaderboard could motivate the most competitive individuals. Awarding medals would confer status on people driven by achievement. Alternatively, intrinsic motivators are things you do for their own sake. Intrinsic motivation is a more powerful way to get people to act in certain ways than extrinsic motivation. Team events like tug-o-war would spur social or community-driven individuals by making the physical activity inherently delightful. A 5k walk around a lake would likewise provide a delightful experience by getting everyone out of the office and into some beautiful scenery.

It's important to balance extrinsic and intrinsic motivations when designing the program. There is a danger that rewards acting as extrinsic motivators can crowd out in the intrinsic motivators that are there. This is called the over-justification effect. If the leaderboards intimidate average or poor performers they might become unengaged by the olympics, likewise if too much emphasis is placed on medals.

The cost of the program should be kept low enough to justify scope of the opportunity. To be conservative, the budget should be $30 million--less than one-third the $94 million reduction in healthcare costs that would result from a 3% improvement. If the program resulted in a 5% improvement it could be considered a runaway success and net a US$188 million return.
