## Definition

Now that you know the essential concepts about gamification and game design, it's time to use them. For this final task, we ask you to bring together creativity, technical feasibility, and business realities.

You are approached by Rashmi Horenstein, the CEO of ShareAll, a prominent company in the hot collaborative consumption space. (If you aren’t familiar with the concept, some good resources are [CollaborativeConsumption.com](http://www.collaborativeconsumption.com/) and the March 9, 2013 [cover story in the Economist](http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21573104-internet-everything-hire-rise-sharing-economy).) She knows you are one of the top experts on gamification, which she has heard can revolutionize business.  She asks you to present a proposal for a gamified system to take her business to the next level.  

ShareAll’s mission is to make shared use of products and services as common as individual purchases.  It follows the path of companies such as [AirBnB](http://www.airbnb.com/), [Buzzcar](http://www.buzzcar.com/), and [Uber](http://www.uber.com/), which allow sharing of particular products (cars, housing, etc).  ShareAll’s patented technology makes it easy for consumers and business to share any product or service.  ShareAll has also developed a global virtual currency, called Shares, which can be used to purchase access to any asset in the system. Shares can be exchanged for real money, and users can generate more Shares by sharing items or volunteering their time to complete tasks for others. 

ShareAll charges a small transaction fee whenever Shares are generated, traded, or spent. Therefore, the more activity, the more money ShareAll makes. Horenstein tells you that she cares about the social benefits of sustainability.  However, ShareAll is a for-profit company, with investments and partnerships from some of the world’s largest corporations, so profits matter. Horenstein believes gamification could significantly help ShareAll’s business. She is eager to read your ideas. 

__Provide a detailed description of your proposal, organized according to the design framework described in the lectures in Unit 7:__

1. Define business objectives
2. Delineate target behaviors
3. Describe your players
4. Devise activity loops
5. Don’t forget the fun!
6. Deploy the appropriate tools

A summary of each concept is provided on the [Gamification Design Framework](https://class.coursera.org/gamification-003/wiki/GamificationDesignFramework) page.


## Format

Maximum of 1500 words.  A normal answer will have descriptive text, and/or a set of bullet points, for each of the six sections of the design framework.  This is your final project. It is the most complex and worth the most points toward your overall score, so you have two weeks to complete it.

Please remember that you have agreed to the Coursera Honor Code as part of your enrollment for this course.  Your submission must be your own work, and not copied from another student or an online resource such as Wikipedia.  Graders will be instructed to assign a score of "0" to plagiarized work.

## Answer

### Intro

You are approached by Rashmi Horenstein, the CEO of ShareAll, a prominent company in the hot collaborative consumption space. ShareAll’s mission is to make shared use of products and services as common as individual purchases. ShareAll’s patented technology makes it easy for consumers and business to share any product or service.

### Define business objectives

Horenstein tells you that she cares about the social benefits of sustainability.  However, ShareAll is a for-profit company, with investments and partnerships from some of the world’s largest corporations, so profits matter.

Basically, if your gamified system does what you intend, what specific positive results will it generate for your organization?


### Delineate target behaviors

ShareAll has also developed a global virtual currency, called Shares, which can be used to purchase access to any asset in the system.

Shares can be exchanged for real money, and users can generate more Shares by sharing items or volunteering their time to complete tasks for others. 

ShareAll charges a small transaction fee whenever Shares are generated, traded, or spent.

What do you want your players to do? And what are the metrics that will allow you to measure them?

The metrics should in some fashion provide feedback to the players, letting them know when they are successfully engaging in the intended behaviors.


### Describe your players

Who are the people who will be participating in your gamified activity? What is their relationship to you?

You can describe your players using demographics (such as age and gender), psychographics (such as their values and personalities), Bartle’s player types, or some other framework.

You should show that you understand what sorts of game elements and other structures are likely to be effective for this population.


### Devise activity loops

First, describe the kinds of feedback your system will offer the players to encourage further action, and explain how this feedback will work to motivate the players.

Second, how if at all will players progress in your system? This includes how the system will get new players engaged, and how it will remain interesting for more experienced players.


### Don’t forget the fun!

In order to fully explore this aspect of the design process, consider how your game would function without any extrinsic rewards. Would you say it was fun? Identify which aspects of the game could continue to motivate players to participate even without rewards.


### Deploy the appropriate tools

If you haven’t already, you should explain in detail what your system would look like. What are some of the game elements involved and what will the experience be like for the players?

Describe what feedback, rewards, and other reinforcements the players could receive.

Finally, think about whether you’ve tied your decisions back to the other five steps in the process, especially the business objectives.


### Conclusion
