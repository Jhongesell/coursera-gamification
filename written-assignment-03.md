## Definition

Now that you know the essential concepts about gamification and game design, it's time to use them. For this final task, we ask you to bring together creativity, technical feasibility, and business realities.

You are approached by Rashmi Horenstein, the CEO of ShareAll, a prominent company in the hot collaborative consumption space. (If you aren’t familiar with the concept, some good resources are [CollaborativeConsumption.com](http://www.collaborativeconsumption.com/) and the March 9, 2013 [cover story in the Economist](http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21573104-internet-everything-hire-rise-sharing-economy).) She knows you are one of the top experts on gamification, which she has heard can revolutionize business. She asks you to present a proposal for a gamified system to take her business to the next level.  

ShareAll’s mission is to make shared use of products and services as common as individual purchases.  It follows the path of companies such as [AirBnB](http://www.airbnb.com/), [Buzzcar](http://www.buzzcar.com/), and [Uber](http://www.uber.com/), which allow sharing of particular products (cars, housing, etc).  ShareAll’s patented technology makes it easy for consumers and business to share any product or service.  ShareAll has also developed a global virtual currency, called Shares, which can be used to purchase access to any asset in the system. Shares can be exchanged for real money, and users can generate more Shares by sharing items or volunteering their time to complete tasks for others. 

ShareAll charges a small transaction fee whenever Shares are generated, traded, or spent. Therefore, the more activity, the more money ShareAll makes. Horenstein tells you that she cares about the social benefits of sustainability.  However, ShareAll is a for-profit company, with investments and partnerships from some of the world’s largest corporations, so profits matter. Horenstein believes gamification could significantly help ShareAll’s business. She is eager to read your ideas. 

__Provide a detailed description of your proposal, organized according to the design framework described in the lectures in Unit 7:__

1. Define business objectives
2. Delineate target behaviors
3. Describe your players
4. Devise activity loops
5. Don’t forget the fun!
6. Deploy the appropriate tools

A summary of each concept is provided on the [Gamification Design Framework](https://class.coursera.org/gamification-003/wiki/GamificationDesignFramework) page.


## Format

Maximum of 1500 words.  A normal answer will have descriptive text, and/or a set of bullet points, for each of the six sections of the design framework.  This is your final project. It is the most complex and worth the most points toward your overall score, so you have two weeks to complete it.

Please remember that you have agreed to the Coursera Honor Code as part of your enrollment for this course.  Your submission must be your own work, and not copied from another student or an online resource such as Wikipedia.  Graders will be instructed to assign a score of "0" to plagiarized work.


## Answer

We can come up with a system to apply game mechanics to help ShareAll's business succeed is by applying Professor Kevin Werbach's six step framework. The steps are as follows:

1. Define business objectives
2. Delineate target behaviors
3. Describe your players
4. Devise activity loops
5. Don’t forget the fun!
6. Deploy the appropriate tools


### Define business objectives

ShareAll profits from any transaction of their in-system "Shares" currency. Therefore a gamification system should increase activities that generate, spend, or trade shares. But what's interesting about this ShareAll's model is that--unlike other collaborative consumption startups--they allow consumers and businesses to share any product or service. Special consideration should be paid to game mechanics that encourage the addition of new products to the ShareAll economy since each new product or service acts as a platform for additional activity.


### Delineate target behaviors

There are four main user activities we want to encourage that will earn ShareAll revenue. Firstly, users can exchange Shares for real money. Secondly, users can generate Shares by volunteering their time to do work for others. Thirdly, they can also generate more Shares by exchanging existing products or services. Lastly, users can put new products or services in the market place.

Since Shares can be converted to real money it is probably undesirable to expose the number of individual users' shares as a public metric. Perhaps users could be ranked by percentile of lifetime shares generated. The number of different products exchanged would encourage users to diversify and explore different aspects of the ShareAll system.


### Describe your players

The type of people likely to participate in this system are young, single or newly married ()without children), located in a dense urban environment, and college educated. They are also likely passionate about (or at least comfortable with) technology as well as price conscious.

Users in this demographic are likely in the millennial generation and located in places like New York City or the Bay Area in California. Individuals like this usually invest in a myriad of mobile devices and tablets. They tend to like integrations with location based services like foursquare and social networks like Twitter and Facebook.


### Devise activity loops

Activity loops provide feedback to the users and encourage them to take further action. They can also serve to change behaviors and motivate. One such loop could be to reward users with a small percentage of Shares upon completion of an agreed upon task. This will help ensure users meet their obligations and encourage them to initiate new exchanges.

Additionally, players could progress within the ShareAll community by obtaining new ranks or titles as they achieve certain totals of lifetime activities. This should keep new players engaged because they will be incentivized to take part, as well as keeping the system interesting for more experienced players.


### Don’t forget the fun!

In addition to focusing on extrinsic rewards and behavior modification, we should consider what is intrinsically pleasing about participating in ShareAll. Here the social interaction becomes extremely important. Collaborative consumption inherently involves repeated interaction with new people and we should assume this drives most users. Another driver is that users should feel they are either getting a service at a very good value or are getting access to a service that would otherwise be unable to experience.


### Deploy the appropriate tools

The appropriate tools for a ShareAll gamification system are:

1. Exposing a public percentile or rank that corresponds to the total lifetime shares the user has earned
2. Social integrations to make sure the intrinsic motivators are clear to users and their network.
3. Badges for sharing a diverse array of products or services or for taking certain uncommon actions such as trading, sharing, or cashing out Shares
4. Small rewards for meeting user's obligations and completing agreed upon tasks
5. A large reward for bringing a totally new product or service to the ShareAll economy

These 5 mechanics should work to increase activity in the areas of the ShareAll economy that earn the company revenue. At the same time they keep the system intrinsically fun and enjoyable and avoids placing too much emphasis on behavior modification and extrinsic rewards.
